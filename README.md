# NHL_weibull
Estimating a Weibull distribution on goal data from the NHL to create a structural model for predicting winning probability. 

Contents:

- Estimate a Weibull distribution from goal data in NHL for a metric of extra win per season per extra goal per game.
- Using the estimate, predict the home team winning probability using Pythagorean Structural Model.
- Compare the Pythagorean Win Model with the Logistic Regression model.

Now, we assume that we are in the mid-season of the NHL, and want to predict second-half season performance.

To do this:
- predict second-half win probability using first-half data and Pythagorean Win Model.
- same for logistic regression
- compare.
